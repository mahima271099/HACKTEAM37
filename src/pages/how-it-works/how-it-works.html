          Waste monitoring and management system is the integration of communication technologies such as RAID, GPS,
          GSM and GIS for truck monitoring system. In proposed system, truck database has been developed in a way that
          information of truck ID, driver ID, date and time of waste collection, etc. are compiled and stored for
          monitoring and management activities. The system is able to monitor the waste collection process and manage
          the overall process of waste management. It provides in time waste collection, vehicle tracking through the
          GIS database using GPS technology and also overcomes the disadvantages such as usage of minimum route, fuel
          cost, clean environment and available vehicle.
